## 02 Customization
- Modify look and feel 
    - Add DMSans font (Modify layout.tsx)
    - Neobrutalism style (neobrutalism.dev - inspiration)

- Add default @/components/ui/ components into page.tsx to see the default look. later we have to make the boarders completely black
    - Button
    - Input
    - Progress
    - Textarea
    - Checkbox

- Modify globals.css
    - Make boarders completely black (for Neobrutalism theme)
> Note: We could do that for component inside of `input.tsx` to change to boarder to black but it's best practise to modify `global.css` as we want all our boarders black.
